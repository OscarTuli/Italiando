<h3> Detto della settimana - Saying of the week </h3>

<p> In Italy, people love employing old sayings in a conversation. Here, you will find a different saying every week, with its translation in English. This week's saying is: 

<strong>"A mali estremi, estremi rimedi!"</strong> - that in English would be traslated as follows: 
"Desperate times call for drastic measures!"

<h2>Further info</h2>

<p>To improve your Italian, we highly recommend <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/course/it/en/Learn-Italian-Online">Duolingo</a>!
It is one of the most popular websites for learning a language. It is completely free and very simple to use! You just need to create a profile and choose a target language (in this case, Italian)! Each language course is made up of many different modules and lessons, and you will need to complete each lesson before proceeding to the next! Also, the website tracks your daily progress, so that you have an idea of what your level should be! Try it yourself, you won't be disappointed!
